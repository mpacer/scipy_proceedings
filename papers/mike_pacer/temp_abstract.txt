Humans are the existence proofs of the solubility of computational causal inference.

I will motivate the desire to study causal Bayesian networks as rational, computational models of causal knowledge. Describing this as it has been used in the context â€¦

Bayesian networks are a framework for expressing probabilistic relationships between random variables using directed acyclic graphs. 

*Causal* Bayesian networks are an extension of these probabilsitic graphical models that additionally include notions of intervening on a node.


I will introduce the mathematical/formal concepts needed to understand what Bayesian networks and their *causal* extension. 

I will discuss how to generate valid networks as subgraphs of a bi-directionally complete directed graph for a given variable set. I will discuss an interpretation of interventions as constraints on this set of subgraphs.

I will then discuss the semantic interpretation of these graphical structures in terms of the constraints they place on the distribution of the variables contained within the network. I will show how to obtain samples from the conditional distributions defined over the graphs variables.

Finally, I will summarize recent work extending the formal reach of these tools, applying them to problems of
