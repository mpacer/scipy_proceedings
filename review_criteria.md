# Suggested Review Criteria for SciPy Proceedings

A small subcommittee of the SciPy 2015 organizing committee has created this 
set of suggested review criteria
to help guide authors and reviewers alike. Suggestions and amendments to these 
review criteria are enthusiastically welcomed via discussion or pull request.


## Written Quality

- Prose should be written in English.
- Prose should clearly communicate the narrative.
- The written style should convey information that furthers the knowledge or 
  research of the reader.
- Due to the interdisciplinary nature of SciPy, highly domain-specific jargon 
  should be avoided or explained where possible.

## Technical Content

- The technical content should be scientifically sound.
- Computational content should, likewise, be verified.
- The work should describe the development or use of python software for 
  approaching a problem in a domain within the scope of the conference.

## Novelty and Impact

- The work should employ new or innovative methods or approaches to a problem.
- The work should advance the state of a scientific domain, the practice 
  of scientific computing itself, or another subject area within the scope of 
  the conference.

## Verifiability

- Software descriptions should be accompanied by references to or examples of 
  representative source code.
- Source code essential to the conclusions of the paper should be made 
  available to the reader.
- Data sources should be identified (e.g., with citation to a persistent DOI).
- Analysis should be accompanied by a workflow description sufficient
  to reproduce the results.

## Other Requirements

- All mentioned software should be formally cited wherever possible.
- Acronyms should be spelled out upon first mention.
- License conditions on images and figures must be respected (Creative Commons, 
  etc.).
- Mathematical and other symbols should be defined.
- Definitions should include consistent units where appropriate.

### Length

- The compiled version should be no longer than 8 pages, including figures.  

### Figures

- All figures and tables should have captions. 
- Figure text should be of a readable size.

### Code Snippets

- Code snippets should be formatted to fit inside a single column without
  overflow.
- If not in Python, the language in the code snippet should be mentioned.
- Code snippets should follow a common style guide. PEP8 is preferred.
